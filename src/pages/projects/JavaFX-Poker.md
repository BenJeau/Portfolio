# Poker
Bilingual poker game programmed in Java by using the JavaFX graphical interface platform and CSS to design the game. For this game to work, you will need to install Java and JavaFX and execute the program located at [/src/application/Main.java](/src/application/Main.java). This game is intended to be played on a 1080p screen and ideally on two monitors since it is a local multiplayer game with only the ability to play against another person. The online aspect of this game is under development and also the ability to play with more than one person online and locally. Because of the way JavaFX works to display images on the screen, the notion of Maps was used to reduce the number of lines of code and to manipulate images with ease.

## Usage
If you only want to play the game, there is an [executable .jar](Poker.jar) in which you can run or if you want to modify the code, the code is in [/src/application](/src/application). You can run the Main.java file, but you can also run directly the game in English with the [/src/application/Engl.java](/src/application/Engl.java) file and in French with the [/src/application/Fran.java](/src/application/Fran.java) file.
